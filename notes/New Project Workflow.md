**1. Describe the Project:**
   - When creating a new project, prompt the user to describe their project in a few sentences. 
   - This description serves a dual purpose: it acts as the project's description and provides context for AI recommendations.

**2. AI Recommendations:**
   - Pass the project description to the AI.
   - The AI analyzes the description and recommends:
     - A list of suitable project templates ranked by relevance.
     - Suggested genres that might fit the project based on the description.
   - These recommendations are based on keyword matching, sentiment analysis, and potential deep learning models trained on existing projects and their descriptions.

**3. Display AI Recommendations:**
   - Present the AI-recommended project templates to the user, perhaps highlighting the top three choices.
   - Similarly, show the suggested genres with an option for the user to confirm or change the selection.
   - Optionally, provide a brief rationale for each recommendation, helping the user understand the AI's choice.

**4. Input Additional Project Information:**
   - While the AI might have made some initial suggestions, the user has the final say. They can:
     - Confirm or change the selected template.
     - Provide additional information such as project name (which might be pre-filled based on the template but editable).
     - Set the project visibility.
     - Add collaborators and reviewers.

**5. Create Writing Project:**
   - This remains the same as the previous process: the new `WritingProjectModel` instance is created using both the user's input and the template details.

**6. Apply Project Structure (optional):**
   - If the selected project template has a predefined structure, this structure can be applied to the new project.

**7. Confirmation and Redirect:**
   - Notify the user that their project has been successfully created.
   - Redirect them to the project's detailed view or another relevant page.

**8. Update Template Usage Count:**
   - After the writing project is created, update the `usage_count` of the template used.

**9. Additional Features:**
   - Consider the ability to refine recommendations: If a user doesn't find any of the AI's initial template or genre suggestions relevant, provide an option to refine recommendations based on further input or questions.
   - Over time, as more users use the platform, consider employing reinforcement learning. This would enable the AI to learn from user template and genre selections, refining its recommendations for future users.
